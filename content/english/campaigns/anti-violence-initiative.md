Amidst social distancing efforts in the wake of COVID-19, social isolation and stay-at-home orders may contribute to increasing the risk/prevalence of human trafficking, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Victims of these forms of violence normally have little access to resources, and social isolation reduces external opportunities for intervention even further. However, there are several roles in leadership/direct service for medical students to get involved!

Local shelter/organization collaborations: We are collaborating with various organizations throughout the city that support victims/survivors of IPV, sexual assault, child abuse, and human trafficking. There are several local opportunities for HMS students to support, advocate, educate, and volunteer with these at-risk populations. Some of the opportunities that are currently available include: pen pal campaign, leading webinar series to improve health literacy/vocational skills, leading stress-relief workshops, and organizing innovative fundraising/donation drives.

COVID 19 Task force on DV collaboration: The COVID19 Task Force on Domestic Violence was formed to investigate, educate, and advocate on behalf of survivors as they face this unprecedented crisis. We have a diverse community of members with interests ranging from Police Department metrics analysis and health care provider resource development to seminar videos educating the public on domestic violence issues and direct advocacy to state and national representatives. If any of our goals or aspirations interest you, email us at covid19taskforcedv@gmail.com and we can find a way to help you get involved.
