If you are in Massachusetts, please refer to the [Massachusetts PPE Coordination Effort collaborative 
document](https://tinyurl.com/wm9htyg). Under the “Outreach Tab” there is a list of local businesses to reach out, including

#### Script

Hi, my name is ___________. I’m reaching out regarding the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to the coronavirus pandemic. We are wondering if you have any masks or other equipment that you could donate to a local hospital. 

Here are some possible questions or talking points:

Why is PPE needed?

* As you may already know, hospitals are running out of the Personal Protective Equipment they need to safely care for our communities and keep themselves and their families safe.

What supplies are needed?

* Masks (N95 respirators, surgical masks), eye protection, face shields, disposable gloves, isolation gowns, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizers
