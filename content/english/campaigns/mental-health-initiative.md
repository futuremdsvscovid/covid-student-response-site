During this time of uncertainty and fear, the new Mental Health Initiative is working to promote #SocialConnectedness while maintaining #PhysicalDistancing. The current scope for outreach is students/faculty/staff within the Harvard community, Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and beyond. Ongoing efforts include compiling local mental health resources, organizing virtual social events, developing a mental health module in the HMS COVID-19 curriculum, and more!

If you’re interested in helping disseminate data, compile resources, and connect communities, feel free to reach out to MS3’s Aliya Feroe (aliya_feroe@hms.harvard.edu) or Okechi Boms (okechi_boms@hms.harvard.edu)
