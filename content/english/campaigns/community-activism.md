### Non-Clinical Support for Healthcare Workers

Student in Boston? Interested in reducing the effects of COVID-19 and flattening the curve? Volunteer to support health care workers. Our hospitals will become inundated with patients in the coming weeks. Health care workers will be working extra shifts to meet the high demand. Personal obligations will limit their ability to do so, especially as schools and childcare centers close. By supporting these health care workers outside the hospital we let them fight the pandemic inside the hospital. Student volunteer services include childcare, grocery and pharmacy runs etc. Please read more [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UiHsHiyT2u7yRh2g1CWHFuxtE0aCKADNR8BXaX9WsnM/viewform?edit_requested=true) to learn if you qualify, sign up, and learn how you can stay safe while volunteering. Healthcare workers can learn more about requesting support [here](https://forms.gle/sxLQRmPvrLbZHcV2A). Please note that this mechanism of matching volunteers and health care workers is not endorsed by or affiliated with any hospital or university.

### Community Voices Initiative

Overview: The Community Voices Initiative is a program that aims to close the gap on social distancing and help minimize social isolation by connecting students with members across the Boston community through meaningful, virtual interactions. During this time of social distancing, all members of our community are at risk of becoming increasingly isolated. Loneliness, anxiety, and fear can have major implications on individuals' health and well-being. [This](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelLJMBQo2YNAKeCCmXjJ_QAwwUO6BLVf9AE6FKfWudBfY3sQ/viewform) is where our student volunteers can help. After signing up as a Community Voices volunteer, we will pair you with a community member at one of our partner organizations, upon which you are encouraged to have conversations about truly anything (e.g. favorite hobbies/games, life stories, favorite movies/artists, memories of loved ones, technology advice, etc.) and develop meaningful relationships to help make a difference during this difficult and uncertain time. More information about specific patient populations is forthcoming and students will have the chance to specify their preferences as more opportunities become available.

### Housing Advocacy

Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) – Please donate to the COVID-19 response fund (https://www.bhchp.org/COVID19) or through the matched fundraiser [here](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/boston-health-care-for-the-homeless-program-covid-19-response/brendaneappen?utm_campaign=oc&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=crowdrise&fbclid=IwAR3L4KEQazB4zCf2W23EBzfeJvowf0rlZ0jAsmeNQJ3eBC8fYu-rFg3NaR8). 

David Velasquez, Henry Ashworth, and Emma Hartswick are investigating current policies protecting individuals in unstable living situations (e.g. motels, sober homes, places not covered by moratorium, halfway houses, etc.) and working to include these protections in legislation.

Brendan Eappen & David Velasquez are investigating opportunities to de-densify homeless shelters by establishing temporary shelters in local schools, recreational centers, etc.

David Velasquez, Henry Ashworth, Emma Hartswick, Michelle Lee, & others are investigating whether Harvard-owned Hotels can be utilized by BHCHP to house homeless patients.

Considering other opportunities for students to volunteer or otherwise support homeless shelters in the area – working with Harvard Square Homeless Shelter
Collaborators – Harvard School of Public Health, Massachusetts General Hospital task force, BHCHP

### Students vs. Pandemics

Students vs. Pandemics is an interdisciplinary group of Harvard grad and undergrad students building community and empowering students to make a positive impact on health and overall wellness during times of crisis. Our three primary goals are to improve transparency and communication, build community, and identify needs and innovate solutions. We share health education material, resources for students, and opportunities to serve our greater community through our [resources spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dTerz_XiSYghoEMn01biDnqqBM_pQIa3S8o-BhEKy-s/edit#gid=531738015) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studentsvspandemics/).

### Mental Health Initiative

During this time of uncertainty and fear, the new Mental Health Initiative is working to promote #SocialConnectedness while maintaining #PhysicalDistancing.

See more here: [Mental Health Initiative](/campaigns/mental-health-initiative/)

### Anti-Violence Initiative

The Anti-Violence Initiative is a set of collaborations aiming to support a population vulnerable to violence within the home. Amidst social distancing efforts in the wake of COVID-19, social isolation and stay-at-home orders may contribute to increasing the risk/prevalence of human trafficking, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Victims of these forms of violence normally have little access to resources, and social isolation reduces external opportunities for intervention even further. However, there are several roles in leadership/direct service for medical students to get involved! 

[Anti-Violence Initiative Volunteer Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaGQ_SYqAjTIOQ8vnZMfeskrv5DAYX3c_yfb5d6TFF9IQJhA/viewform)

Local shelter/organization collaborations: We are collaborating with various organizations throughout the city that support victims/survivors of IPV, sexual assault, child abuse, and human trafficking. There are several local opportunities for HMS students to support, advocate, educate, and volunteer with these at-risk populations. Some of the opportunities that are currently available include: pen pal campaign, leading webinar series to improve health literacy/vocational skills, leading stress-relief workshops, and organizing innovative fundraising/donation drives. 

Email [jaya_prakash@hms.harvard.edu](mailto:jaya_prakash@hms.harvard.edu) for more information on how to get involved 

COVID 19 Task force on DV collaboration: The COVID19 Task Force on Domestic Violence was formed to investigate, educate, and advocate on behalf of survivors as they face this unprecedented crisis. We have a diverse community of members with interests ranging from Police Department metrics analysis and health care provider resource development to seminar videos educating the public on domestic violence issues and direct advocacy to state and national representatives. If any of our goals or aspirations interest you, email us at covid19taskforcedv@gmail.com and we can find a way to help you get involved. 

Email [covid19taskforcedv@gmail.com](mailto:covid19taskforcedv@gmail.com) for more information on how to get involved
