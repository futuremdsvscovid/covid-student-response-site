During this time of social distancing, all of us are at risk of becoming increasingly
isolated. **The Community Voices** Initiative is a program that aims to help minimize
social isolation by connecting students with members across the Boston community
through meaningful, virtual interactions. Together, we can build a stronger sense of
community and connection. After signing up, a community member and student will be
paired together for phone conversations at a time and frequency that they mutually
agree upon. We encourage pairs to have conversations about truly anything
(e.g. favorite hobbies/games, life stories, favorite movies/artists, memories of
loved ones, technology advice, etc.) and develop meaningful relationships to foster
a greater sense of community during this difficult and uncertain time.

**Interested community members, sign up here:** [https://forms.gle/xcu1t1WdZ1moA9rr5](https://forms.gle/xcu1t1WdZ1moA9rr5 "https://forms.gle/xcu1t1WdZ1moA9rr5")

If you know someone in the Boston area who would be interested in participating
in the Community Voices Initiative, but isnâ€™t able to sign up online, they can call
our registration line at <u>(617) 651-1909</u>.
