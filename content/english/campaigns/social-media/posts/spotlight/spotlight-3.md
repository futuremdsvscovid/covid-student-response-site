A day at work now looks completely different than it did just a few weeks ago. As I walk into the hospital, I am presented with one surgical mask - the only mask I get for my 12 hour shift. All of the protective equipment we used to stock on the floors has been taken away and is now centralized. Employees must go to one of three distribution centers in the hospital in order to obtain masks or face shields. I already had patients on droplet precautions last week, so will have to reuse that same face shield which I saved in a brown paper bag with my name on it. As I walk onto my unit, I see my colleagues emotionally drained, and just as anxious and nervous about this deadly virus as I am. We are trying to conserve PPE as best as we can, as even used PPE is better than nothing at this point.  I try to smile under my mask and make sense of all that’s going on around me. I’m proud to be a nurse, but I am SCARED. I am grateful to work with amazing nurses, PCAs, MDs, and PAs who have truly come together to support one another during this time.  Be kind. Pray. Stay home, stay safe, and wash your hands! 💜  “Courage is not having the strength to go on; it is going on when you don't have the strength” - Theodore Roosevelt
