### "All the Small Things" music video

Amidst all the stressors of the past few weeks, we wanted to send an important message on a lighter note, highlighting "All the Small Things" we can do to help flatten the COVID-19 transmission curve and save lives. By practicing social distancing and proper hygienic practices, we can beat COVID-19 and minimize its potential impact on our communities. Thanks for indulging, and stay safe out there!
