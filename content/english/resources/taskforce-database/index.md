            <h3>Medical School Task Forces</h3>
            <p>
                This database is a collaboration between the students at Harvard University and 
                University of Vermont Medical School 
                (<u><a href="https://publichealthcoalition.org" target="_blank">Medical Student COVID-19 Action Network - MSCAN</a></u>). 
                The purpose of this database is to crowdsource initiatives that students are offering to their 
                communities in light of increased demand on the healthcare system. In the next iteration of the 
                database, we will include details of specific initiatives as well as student leader information as a 
                means of fostering collaboration between medical schools and to connect interested parties with 
                opportunities to contribute to the COVID19 effort.                
            </p>
