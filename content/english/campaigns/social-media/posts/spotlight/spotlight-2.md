I have been a Medical Technologist at our non-profit Nashville General Hospital for going on 27 years​, and I've learned a lot. Healing is a natural miracle that can't be explained scientifically. It is an inherent property of all life as is homeostasis of living systems. When you love your patients as family and feel deep empathy, your impact on their healing process will be exponential. You are also commanded to give the same attention to yourselves during your application of healing modalities. Self care actually must come first. So take naps. Watch comedy. Walk in nature. Feed yourself well. Call family and friends while mucking through this crisis. Love yourself and others. We will all heal together.
