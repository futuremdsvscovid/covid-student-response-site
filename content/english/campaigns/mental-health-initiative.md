## Education

#### COVID-19 Mental Health Curriculum Module

The Mental Health Initiative (MHI) team is actively working with the
[COVID-19
Curriculum](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/)
team to create a module on mental health. The module will critically
assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental health of patients,
with a focus on specific at-risk populations. It also identifies basic
tools for responding to these changes in the clinical setting.

#### MM Workout of the Day

Medicine in Motion (MM) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization composed
of a diverse group of healthcare providers whose mission is to address
medical burnout through fitness, interdisciplinary community building,
and philanthropy.

The MM Workout of the Day (WOD) is a joint effort between our Harvard
and Dartmouth chapters to encourage our communities to stay physically
and mentally fit while maintaining social closeness and physical
distancing through the COVID-19 pandemic. We will be posting different
workouts and videos that you can do at home with equipment that you can
make from items around your living space. We are excited to share these,
but also want to mention that during this challenging time, no one
should feel pressure to exercise. Physical and mental health takes on
many forms and these workouts are only one. We hope that they are a
source of inspiration to help you share time with the people you love.
If you are not a fan of today's MM WOD, do not worry! Please see our
library where we will continue to build a large archive of workouts for
whatever you may be interested in.

## Building Virtual Communities

#### Social Events Calendar

As a part of the Mental Health Initiative, we\'ve organized a few
social, wellness and mindfulness events across the month for HMS
students to come together, reflect, have some fun and build community.
Past events and upcoming events include karaoke night, virtual game
night, and an open mic night. Please refer to this
[**calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=aHJrYXZyMW5uZTdtcjFiMmdhNGUzdTgyZGNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
for more details. To add events to the calendar, please reach out to

#### HMS Book Club

A **BOOK CLUB** is also in the works, so please fill out the form linked
if you are interested. We\'re potentially reading Albert Camus\' The
Plague which has eerie echoes of what\'s going on today but if people
are COVID19 overloaded we\'ll pick out a different book or read other
things together! We\'ll be going very SLOWLY so don\'t let that stop you
from signing up.

#### Zoomaments

We hope you are all staying safe during these rapidly evolving times. To
help kindle a sense of community amidst this period of social
distancing, we are excited to, again, invite **Harvard Medical Students from all years** to participate in
Zoomaments. \"What are Zoomaments, and why should I be so excited?\",
you may be wondering.

Many of you may be more familiar with Lunchaments, a program started by
the Class of 2020 that coordinates lunch between randomly-paired
1st-year HMS/HSDM students. In a similar vein, Zoomaments is a way for
students to get paired with one another for weekly 1-on-1 and small
group meals/hang-outs over Zoom. Every week, the Zoomaments team will
randomly pair students with peers from their respective classes. Each
student will receive brief introductory information about their partners
and then be encouraged to find a time to connect virtually.

If, after reading all of this, you are as excited as we are, we invite
you again to fill out this brief [interest
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRh8695y5WZhJmC7IQgT4JYyzR1gp7uynDZJieooUmeYlHuQ/viewform).
You can join at any time as the Zoomaments team is always sending out
pairings week to week! Also, feel free to discontinue Zoomaments at any
time by just sending us an email:)
