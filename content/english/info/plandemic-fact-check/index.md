## Masks and the Immune System

### The Claim:

> Mask use weakens the immune system because it interferes with the normal bacteria that live on the body, leading to increased risk for serious infection and a second peak of COVID-19 cases when social distancing stops.

### What the Data Show: 

-   There is no evidence that mask use weakens the immune system. We all have harmless types of bacteria living on the surface of our bodies, and [evidence suggests](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(14)00345-6) that they might affect the way our immune systems behave, but wearing a mask does not make these bacteria go away.

-   The data on the usefulness of masks are mixed. While in principle, fabric provides a physical barrier that filters potentially infected particles, scientists are still working to figure out exactly how well masks and various mask materials work. Some data suggest that [surgical masks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2) and [homemade masks made of multiple layers of heavy materials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.0c03252) can be extremely effective while [other studies](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-1342) have had less promising results. Regardless of the exact effectiveness of mask use, masks only work when they fit well over the nose and mouth with minimal gaps between the edges of the mask and the skin of the face.

-   One key goal of universal mask use is to minimize disease spread by people who are infected but either have not yet shown symptoms or never go on to develop symptoms of COVID-19. [This model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5) has shown that this group of patients could be responsible for 44% of the spread of this disease. Since symptoms are not a perfect indicator of infection, our best chance to minimize disease spread is to behave like everyone could be infected when we are out in public spaces. When everybody wears a mask, everybody has two layers of protection from infected particles in the air: 1) they are guarded by their own mask and 2) they are guarded by the mask worn by the people who did not know that they were infected but still wore a mask just in case.

-   Although [our current models do predict a later peak](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/24/science.abb5793) in COVID-19 cases after social distancing measures relax, this peak is not caused by weakened immune systems. Instead, the problem is that our immune systems are only trained to effectively fight viruses similar to the ones that they have seen before, and COVID-19 is caused by a new virus: SARS-CoV-2. As a result, when lots of people with healthy immune systems that are just not trained to fight SARS-CoV-2 come back into social environments that expose us to the virus, people get sick. This is not an unexpected problem that can only be explained by masks weakening the immune system. Instead, it is an unfortunate but completely expected drawback to the way our immune systems work.

-   Fortunately, because we know about this risk of a later peak, the medical community is also working on strategies to minimize later rises in case counts. [One proposed strategy](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/24/science.abb5793) is the use of multiple shorter periods of on-and-off social distancing rather than relying on a one-and-done approach. Models supporting this strategy show that it can keep the case count low enough to avoid overwhelming our healthcare system when cases rise again.

-   Finally, while masks do not weaken the immune system, [stress might](https://www.apa.org/research/action/immune). Now is a stressful time, and unfortunately, stress has been linked with changes in immune system function and increased risk of infections. On the other hand, making an effort to minimize stress, eat a well-balanced diet, stay active, and get enough sleep can help improve immune system activity.

### The Takeaway:

Mask use does not weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection. Instead, wearing a mask helps to keep your community safe by preventing the accidental spread of COVID-19 by people who are infected but do not show symptoms. In addition to wearing a mask, you can also improve your immune system by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing stress.

## Influenza Vaccine and COVID-19 Risk

### The Claim:

> The flu vaccine increases risk for COVID-19 infection.

### What the Data Show:

-   [There have not been any studies](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/no-evidence-that-flu-shot-increases-risk-of-covid-19/) that have linked the flu vaccine with COVID-19 infection. [The study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126676/) on military personnel and their beneficiaries mentioned in the video looked for diagnosis of respiratory viral illness in members of the Department of Defense who either did or did not receive the flu vaccine during the 2017-2018 flu season. Overall, their data suggested that the flu vaccine did not increase the risk of getting other viral airway or lung diseases. Although this study did report higher odds of coronavirus infection among those who received the flu vaccine, the coronaviruses mentioned here refer to the ones that cause the common cold, not SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the data analyzed to draw this conclusion came from the 2017-2018 flu season, which is well before SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in humans in December 2019. Also, this study did not account for several important variables including age and season of infection for different categories of respiratory viruses, which could have affected their results.

-   On the other hand, the flu vaccine could help keep you out of clinics and emergency rooms. According to an [interim report from the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6907a1.htm), this year's flu vaccine has been 45% effective at reducing medical visits associated with the flu. Although the vaccine is not perfect, it can [prevent millions of medical visits and save thousands of lives](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm). This reduction in medical visits is critical during a pandemic when the healthcare system is being stretched. Getting the flu vaccine is important, not only to keep you healthy but also to free up medical resources to treat patients with COVID-19.

### The Takeaway: 

There is no evidence to suggest that getting the flu vaccine increases the risk of COVID-19 infection. Getting vaccinated decreases your chances of getting sick with the flu, keeps you out of the hospital, and helps healthcare workers maintain enough resources to treat people who get sick with COVID-19.

## Hydroxychloroquine

### The Claim:

> Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for COVID-19.

### What the Data Show:

-   Data on hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 have been mixed at best, and there are several key flaws in the studies that have investigated its use. In February and March, there were reports out of China and a study conducted in France suggesting that hydroxychloroquine might be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Unfortunately, [the study in France](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102549/) was very small and was not randomized. Randomization in clinical trials is important for preventing various types of biases from affecting the results of the study. Without randomization, there is no way to know whether improvements that we assume to be caused by hydroxychloroquine were caused by the drug itself or if for some reason, doctors tended to choose this drug when treating patients who shared some other characteristic that made them more likely to get better in the first place. As such, even though the group of study participants receiving hydroxychloroquine in this study did clear the virus faster, it's tough to know what to conclude from this study, especially since 6 out of the 26 patients who received hydroxychloroquine were not included in the results for various reasons. According to the study authors, 3 of these 6 were transferred to an intensive care unit and 1 of them died, meaning their exclusion could make the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine look better than it really is.

-   A [more recent study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2012410) published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked for whether hydroxychloroquine reduced rates of intubation and death. There were 1376 patients included in their study, of whom 811 had received hydroxychloroquine. They found that hydroxychloroquine use doesn't change the rate of intubation or death in either direction, although it should be noted that this study was also not randomized.

-   A [randomized control trial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2765499) conducted in Brazil with 81 participants at the time of analysis compared high and low dose chloroquine as treatment for hospitalized patients with confirmed or likely COVID-19. The authors found that the higher dosage of chloroquine was associated with toxicity and death. That said, it is important to note that these patients were also receiving other medications, which complicates the interpretation. Still, based on their results, the researchers stopped giving the higher dose and recommended against giving high-dose chloroquine to critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially at the same time as certain other medications.

-   In addition, after reviewing case reports in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database, published studies, and the American Association of Poison Control Centers, [the FDA has specifically warned](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or) against using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 outside of hospitals or clinical trials because it has been associated with an increased risk for heart rhythm problems, especially when combined with other drugs that also affect heart rhythm.

### The Takeaway: 

-   It's unclear if hydroxychloroquine could be an effective treatment for COVID-19. Multiple studies in different patient populations around the world have shown mixed results on efficacy and safety. While it is possible that hydroxychloroquine could be helpful in certain groups of patients, some doctors are recommending against its use because of serious concerns about patient safety.
