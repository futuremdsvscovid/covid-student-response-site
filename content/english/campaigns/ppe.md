## HMS PPE Shortage Initiative 

The shortage of person protective equipment (PPE) is already affecting our medical workers ability to protect themselves, our patients, and our public.

Reach out to local businesses and organizations to collect PPE donations
Connect PPE vendors to local hospitals
Coordinate efforts with individuals and companies working on mask creation and innovation
Work to advocate for PPE legislation 
Spread the word regarding the PPE shortage! 

All while collaborating with the numerous ongoing PPE intiaitives and organizations including: 
GetusPPE.org, DonatePPE.org, MGB COVID Innovation Center, Boston Mask Initaitive, and many more.
