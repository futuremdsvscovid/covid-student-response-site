Overview: The Community Voices Initiative is a program that aims to close the gap on social distancing and help minimize social isolation by connecting students with members across the Boston community through meaningful, virtual interactions. During this time of social distancing, all members of our community are at risk of becoming increasingly isolated. Loneliness, anxiety, and fear can have major implications on individuals' health and well-being. [This](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelLJMBQo2YNAKeCCmXjJ_QAwwUO6BLVf9AE6FKfWudBfY3sQ/viewform) is where our student volunteers can help. After signing up as a Community Voices volunteer, we will pair you with a community member at one of our partner organizations, upon which you are encouraged to have conversations about truly anything (e.g. favorite hobbies/games, life stories, favorite movies/artists, memories of loved ones, technology advice, etc.) and develop meaningful relationships to help make a difference during this difficult and uncertain time. More information about specific patient populations is forthcoming and students will have the chance to specify their preferences as more opportunities become available.
