The COVID-19 Health Literacy Project was started by [Pooja Chandrashekar](https://poojachandrashekar.com/), a first-year medical student at Harvard Medical School, and quickly expanded into a national coalition of over 150 medical students representing over 35 institutions and 34 languages. In an effort to help patients from vulnerable communities know when and how to seek care, we set out to create and translate accessible COVID-19 information into different languages. All of our materials are carefully reviewed and vetted by faculty members at Harvard Medical School, and are created in collaboration with Harvard Health Publishing.
