Led by Indigenous youth, the COVID-19 Indigenous Health Partnership brings 
together medical students, physicians, allied health professionals, 
and human rights experts to partner with Indigenous Peoples and communities 
on their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Purpose

* Organizing translation of culturally relevant, medically verified COVID19 documents and videos into Indigenous languages.
* Offering culturally aware consultation/technical guidance to Indigenous community leaders on their COVID19 action plans.
* Publishing articles on what Indigenous community partners are facing during the pandemic and how they are responding for advocacy support.
* Hosting webinars with UNICEF focused on Indigenous youth mental health during the pandemic.
* Connecting Indigenous communities to resources for medical equipment, telemedicine, and other assistance.
