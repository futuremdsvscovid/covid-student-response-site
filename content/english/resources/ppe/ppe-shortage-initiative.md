## HMS PPE Shortage Initiative

The HMS PPE Shortage Initiative is working to improve access to PPE for
medical workers. We have been coordinating with numerous other PPE
initiatives in order to:

-   Encourage the community and businesses to donate surplus PPE

-   Connect PPE donors and PPE vendors to hospitals

-   Advocate for PPE legislation

-   Help with mask innovation

-   Colloborate, coordinate, and support other on-going PPE initiatives
