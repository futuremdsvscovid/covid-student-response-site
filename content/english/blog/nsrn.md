The Harvard Medical School COVID-19 Student Response Team is joining forces with the National Student Response Network (NSRN),
a national student-run organization of health professional students (MD/DO, PA, nursing), mobilizing to support hospitals, other healthcare facilities, and state/local public health departments in their non-clinical COVID-19 response.
NSRN supports all healthcare essential workers, including frontline providers, security, environmental and dining services etc., in the below roles for just some examples:

* Childcare/pet care
* Grocery/pharmacy shopping and delivery
* PPE drives/distribution
* Telehealth assistance for COVID-19 lab result dissemination, IT support, triaging on COVID-19 hotlines

**If your institution is need of volunteers, please complete this form:** https://forms.gle/TPQFgqis74qkwvTt5

**If you would like to volunteer, please sign up here:** https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJQm5gwxpjAck9ZheqmgCZyNTfVBImYL143dkiu0 gF9jy2rQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1oTCHqFnvy4VsuBdqUdaTgzrEC6LPu1ooaawIAMMdomcIA0zM 8SUqLsD0

NSRN particularly focuses on non-academic affiliated healthcare facilities, as many academic hospitals already have large, local support networks, but we will respond to all inquiries. We also cater towards students who have been displaced from their home school state/location, but still want to be involved in the student COVID-19 response. While we have focused on health professional students, as we expand, we have needs for all graduate students!
