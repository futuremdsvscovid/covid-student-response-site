### HEALTHCARE WORKERS NEED OUR HELP.

Hospitals are in dire need of supplies to protect those fighting at the front lines. They canâ€™t help others if they get sick. Wear a mask if you are sick or if you are taking care of someone who is sick - otherwise, save masks for others who need them. Donation link: https://DonatePPE.org. Sign the petition to ask the White House to pass legislation to make companies produce more necessary supplies like PPE: https://getusppe.org/sign.
