#### Mask Transit (NY and Boston)

Mask Transit is a medical student and volunteer run organization started
in New York City and Boston. Our goal is to mobilize masks to our most
vulnerable community members, who are at the highest risk of acquiring
COVID-19. Boston has not yet reached its peak , so we hope that by
getting these masks out as fast as we can, we can help in flattening the
curve. Our hope is that these masks will serve as valuable tools in
decreasing the number of new infections while simultaneously decreasing
the burden on the healthcare system.
