### Non-Clinical Support for Healthcare Workers

Student in Boston? Interested in reducing the effects of COVID-19 and flattening the curve? Volunteer to support health care workers. Our hospitals will become inundated with patients in the coming weeks. Health care workers will be working extra shifts to meet the high demand. Personal obligations will limit their ability to do so, especially as schools and childcare centers close. By supporting these health care workers outside the hospital we let them fight the pandemic inside the hospital. Student volunteer services include childcare, grocery and pharmacy runs etc. Please read more [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UiHsHiyT2u7yRh2g1CWHFuxtE0aCKADNR8BXaX9WsnM/viewform?edit_requested=true) to learn if you qualify, sign up, and learn how you can stay safe while volunteering. Healthcare workers can learn more about requesting support [here](https://forms.gle/sxLQRmPvrLbZHcV2A). Please note that this mechanism of matching volunteers and health care workers is not endorsed by or affiliated with any hospital or university.

### Community Voices Initiative

Overview: The Community Voices Initiative is a program that aims to close the gap on social distancing and help minimize social isolation by connecting students with members across the Boston community through meaningful, virtual interactions. During this time of social distancing, all members of our community are at risk of becoming increasingly isolated. Loneliness, anxiety, and fear can have major implications on individuals' health and well-being. [This](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelLJMBQo2YNAKeCCmXjJ_QAwwUO6BLVf9AE6FKfWudBfY3sQ/viewform) is where our student volunteers can help. After signing up as a Community Voices volunteer, we will pair you with a community member at one of our partner organizations, upon which you are encouraged to have conversations about truly anything (e.g. favorite hobbies/games, life stories, favorite movies/artists, memories of loved ones, technology advice, etc.) and develop meaningful relationships to help make a difference during this difficult and uncertain time. More information about specific patient populations is forthcoming and students will have the chance to specify their preferences as more opportunities become available.

### Housing Advocacy

Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) – Please donate to the COVID-19 response fund (https://www.bhchp.org/COVID19) or through the matched fundraiser [here](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/boston-health-care-for-the-homeless-program-covid-19-response/brendaneappen?utm_campaign=oc&utm_medium=facebook&utm_source=crowdrise&fbclid=IwAR3L4KEQazB4zCf2W23EBzfeJvowf0rlZ0jAsmeNQJ3eBC8fYu-rFg3NaR8). 

David Velasquez, Henry Ashworth, and Emma Hartswick are investigating current policies protecting individuals in unstable living situations (e.g. motels, sober homes, places not covered by moratorium, halfway houses, etc.) and working to include these protections in legislation.

Brendan Eappen & David Velasquez are investigating opportunities to de-densify homeless shelters by establishing temporary shelters in local schools, recreational centers, etc.

David Velasquez, Henry Ashworth, Emma Hartswick, Michelle Lee, & others are investigating whether Harvard-owned Hotels can be utilized by BHCHP to house homeless patients.
