#### Here’s what you can do:

Call local businesses, including:

Ask if they have supplies they would be willing to donate. Here is a sample script to follow:

#### Script

Hi, my name is ___________. I’m reaching out regarding the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment due to the coronavirus pandemic. We are wondering if you have any masks or other equipment that you could donate to a local hospital. 

Here are some possible questions or talking points:

Why is PPE needed?

* As you may already know, hospitals are running out of the Personal Protective Equipment they need to safely care for our communities and keep themselves and their families safe.

What supplies are needed?

* Masks (N95 respirators, surgical masks), eye protection, face shields, disposable gloves, isolation gowns, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizers

How do we donate?

Fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YSXn7vL6BaxqDXdiJkyYeJlsneW-ASFA7y7a3MUmQ_0/viewform?edit_requested=true) if you have supplies. Students volunteering with MedSupplyDrive will connect with you to find the best way to donate to a hospital. They have volunteers all around the country who will help with pick ups and donations to a list of hospitals who desperately need your help.
